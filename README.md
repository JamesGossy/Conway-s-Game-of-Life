Conway's Game of Life

This program simulates Conway's Game of Life. It starts with a grid where each cell is randomly alive or dead. The grid updates at each step following simple rules based on the number of living neighbors each cell has.

How it works:
- A cell turns alive if it was dead and has exactly three living neighbors.
- A cell stays alive if it has two or three living neighbors.
- Otherwise, a cell dies or stays dead.

Run the script to see how the grid evolves over time. You can change the grid size and pause time in the script.
